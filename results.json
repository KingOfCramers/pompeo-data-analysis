The President – our first president to have an executive order on religious freedom – he spoke about that in deeply personal terms at the United Nations – guess it would have been a year ago at the United Nations General Assembly. This is something that the American people demand that their leaders speak up about, and that’s what I was doing. I was honoring the Catholic Church’s power, its capacity for moral good around the world. I believe that deeply and we urge them to continue to use their persuasive power, their ability to affect the hearts and minds of people all across the world to improve the lives of people who are in very difficult situations all around the world, including inside of China.",

One of those priorities is to talk about religious freedom and fundamental rights. Another priority is to make sure that we have partners and allies who will work alongside of us to help push back against those that are trying to do real harm to the United States of America. Saudi Arabia is that. I contrast that. People will say, well, goodness, you go after Iran but not Saudi Arabia. Well, we talk about – we talk about religious freedom and the way human beings ought to be treated in both places, but one country is trying to destroy Israel. One country has said “death to America;” the other is our partner working for security cooperation to make sure that people in California, in Kansas, in New York, in Pennsylvania are safe.",

This central premise of religious freedom makes countries stronger. It doesn’t create risk, which is what I think some of the countries like China are concerned with when they exercise political repression against various religious faiths.

This is an example where a higher degree of religious freedom around the world would create less risk not only for the citizens of their own country but for Americans as they travel abroad. Pastor Brunson’s case is very much a focus of the team that I lead here at the State Department, and we’re optimistic that in the days and weeks ahead we’ll get a good outcome for Pastor Brunson, his family, and frankly for many of those that are held in places around the world.",
